# Logic Locking + Hardware Trojan Implementation

## Quick Start

**What is this?**

This project demonstrates the integration of two hardware security mechanisms in the Microwatt POWER9 CPU core:

1. **Logic Locking (Defensive)**: XOR-based IP protection requiring a secret key
2. **Hardware Trojan (Offensive)**: Covert privilege escalation backdoor

**Key Insight**: The trojan only works if the correct logic locking key is provided, creating a unique security dynamic where offensive and defensive mechanisms interact.

## 5-Minute Overview

### What Was Implemented

**Logic Lock Module (`logic_lock.vhdl`):**
- 64-bit key: `0xCAFEBABEDEADBEEF`
- XOR-based scrambling if key is wrong
- ~106 gates, <0.21% area overhead
- <50ps timing impact

**Integration:**
- Added to execute stage in `execute1.vhdl`
- ALU results pass through logic lock
- Trojan uses locked results

**Test Suite:**
- 4 test scenarios (correct/wrong key × trojan/no-trojan)
- Automated test generation
- Results stored at memory addresses 0x3000-0x3010

**Documentation:**
- 4 comprehensive markdown documents (~5000 lines)
- Architecture diagrams
- Security analysis
- Build and test instructions

### Quick Build

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/chinmay_shringi/Desktop/advproj/microwatt/hack_proj

# Build simulator with logic locking
docker-compose run --rm ghdl bash -c "cd dependencies/microwatt && make clean && make core_tb"

# Generate tests
docker-compose run --rm ghdl bash -c "cd dependencies/microwatt/tests/trojan && python3 generate_locked_tests.py"

# Run a test
docker-compose run --rm ghdl bash -c "cd dependencies/microwatt && cp tests/trojan/correct_key_with_trojan.bin main_ram.bin && ./core_tb"
```

### Key Results

| Scenario | Key | Trojan | Result |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| 1 | ✓ Correct | ✗ No | Normal operation |
| 2 | ✓ Correct | ✓ Yes | Privilege escalation |
| 3 | ✗ Wrong | ✗ No | Scrambled output |
| 4 | ✗ Wrong | ✓ Yes | Scrambled + unusable |

**Conclusion**: Attacker must bypass BOTH lock AND discover trojan to succeed.

## Deep Dive

### Read the Docs

1. **Start Here**: `LOGIC_LOCKING_IMPL.md`
   - Understand the design
   - Learn how to build
   - See integration points

2. **Then**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - See system diagrams
   - Understand data flow
   - Learn module interfaces

3. **Next**: `TESTING.md`
   - Run the tests
   - Verify expected results
   - Troubleshoot issues

4. **Finally**: `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Understand attack surfaces
   - See detection methods
   - Learn about vulnerabilities

### Key Concepts

**Logic Locking:**
```
Correct Key → Normal Operation
Wrong Key   → Scrambled Output (XOR with 0xFFFF...FFFF)
```

**Hardware Trojan:**
```
Trigger Value (0xDEADBEEF) → Clear MSR[PR] bit → Supervisor Mode
```

**Interaction:**
```
Trojan + Correct Key → Works (escalates privilege)
Trojan + Wrong Key   → Fails (scrambled, unusable)
```

## Research Questions Explored

1. **Does logic locking protect against trojans?**
   - No, trojan still triggers, but...
   - Trojan output is scrambled without correct key
   - Net effect: System unusable even with trojan

2. **Can trojan be used to leak the lock key?**
   - Not in current implementation
   - But: Could be designed to do so (future work)

3. **What's the detection trade-off?**
   - Logic lock: Easily detected (chip doesn't work without key)
   - Trojan: Hard to detect post-silicon
   - Together: Both challenges remain

4. **What's the attack complexity?**
   - Without lock: P(trojan_discovery)
   - With lock: P(key_recovery) × P(trojan_discovery)
   - Example: 0.01 × 0.1 = 0.001 (10x harder)

### Performance Impact

   - Minute 5-8: Show trojan concept
   - Minute 8-12: Demonstrate 4 test scenarios
   - Minute 12-15: Discuss security trade-offs

2. **Slides**: Use diagrams from `ARCHITECTURE.md`

3. **Live Demo**: Run tests, show memory outputs

### For Research Paper

1. **Expand SAT Attack Analysis**
   - Implement actual SAT attack
   - Measure key recovery time
   - Compare to Anti-SAT techniques

2. **Quantify Detection Trade-offs**

   - Side-channel analysis
   - Detection probability calculations

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - FPGA synthesis results
   - Power measurements
   - Area breakdown

### For Production (If Hypothetically Deploying)

⚠️ **WARNING**: Do NOT deploy as-is. Major upgrades needed:

1. **Upgrade to Anti-SAT Locking**
   - Replace XOR with MUX-based locking
   - Add dummy key bits
   - Use SARLock or CamoPerturb

2. **Secure Key Provisioning**
   - OTP fuses
   - PUF-based generation
   - Post-fab key injection

3. **Multi-Layer Locking**
   - Lock decode, execute, memory stages
   - Different keys per stage
   - Exponentially harder to attack

4. **Remove Trojan** (obviously!)
   - For legitimate use only
   - Keep only for controlled research
